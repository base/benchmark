name: TX-Fuzz Geth Performance
description: |
  Transaction Fuzzing Test - Stress tests Geth with randomized transaction patterns to discover edge cases and performance degradation under unusual transaction loads.

  This benchmark uses a transaction fuzzer to generate diverse transaction patterns, helping identify potential vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and edge cases that might not be covered by standard transaction patterns.

  Use Case: Discover edge cases and performance degradation under unusual transaction loads, stress test transaction processing logic, validate client robustness under diverse transaction patterns, and identify potential security or performance issues.
